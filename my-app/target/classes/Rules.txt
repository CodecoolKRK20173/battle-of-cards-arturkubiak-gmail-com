Welcome to the BATTLE OF CARDS: FOOTBALL game! Here are some instructions, rules and tips for you:

1.Minimum number of players is 2, maximum is 4.
2.Each player can be set up as a real player or computer player.
3.Available game variants provide decks with 24 or 60 cards.
4.Cards are drawn from among 200 available in the base - they can be repeated.
5.Each card has its name and 6 statistics used during the game.
6.The player starting the game chooses one of 6 statistics, which is then compared with the same parameter placed on rivals' cards.
7.In each round, the statistics that will be used for comparison are selected by the winner of the last round.
8.In case of draw:
    -the cards from the previous round go to the buffer,
    -the next cards are taken from the deck of players who have drawn the previous round,
    -new cards are compared according to the same category as in the previous round,
    -the winner takes both new cards and cards from the buffer.
9.Choosing the highest stats from those on the card is not always the best tactic!
10.Some statistics are rated high on a smaller number of cards than others - during the game you will find out which statistics.
11.The computer already knows which statistics are at stake and is quite good at using this knowledge!
12.The game ends when one player has all the cards from the deck.

HAVE A GOOD FUN! :)
